Register descriptions

	1-bit register
		this bits are written after every ALU operation (ADD, INC, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, SHL, NOP) 
		Zero		Set if every output bit of ALU is cleared   
		Sign		Set if highest bit is set
		Overflow	Set if ther is an overflow condition during ADD or INC operation

	8-bit registers
	name	access from 8-bit bus
		A		RW - general purpose register, used by ALU as first operand   
		B 		RW - general purpose register, used by ALU as first operand
		C		RW  - general purpose register
		D 		RW - general purpose register
		M1		RW - lower byte of 16-bit register M
		M2		RW - higher byte of 16-bit register M
		X		RW - lower byte of 16-bit register XY
		Y		RW - higher byte of 16-bit register XY
		J1		W  - lower byte of 16-bit register J
		J2 		W  - higher byte of 16-bit register J
		Inst	NA - special register, storing active instruction, accessed only by controler
		 
	16-bit register
	name	access from 16-bit bus
 		PC		RW - program counter, storing actual position in memory
 		M		R  - memory address, storing address for storing and loading variabiles from memory
 		XY		RW - general purpose register, used by call instruction as return address
 				   - only register with RW access from both 8-bit and 16-bit bus
		J		R  - jump address, storing address for jump and call instruction
		INC		R  - special register, used for incrementing any data enabled on 16-bit bus

Command description

	move	source	destination
	Move data between registers
		Write data from source register to destination register
		Both source and the destination have to be either 8-bit or 16-bit registers
		8-bit registers
			Sources 		A, B, C, D, X, Y, M1, M2
			Destinations	A, B, C4, D, X, Y, M1, M2
		16-bit registers
			Sourcers		PC, INC, J, M, XY, FFFF (1), 0000 (1)
			Destinations	PC, XY
			notes: 
				(1) FFFF and 0000 are not real registers only hard wired fixed values
				
	load	destination		[address | variabile name]
	Load data from memory
		Load data to destination register from memory address stored in M register
		If address or varaiabile name is specified, then M register is loded with specified address first
		Destinations		A, B, C, D, X, Y, J1, J2
		
	store	source			[address | variabile name]
	Instructions takes 8 clock cycles
	Store data to memory
		Write data from source register to memory address stored in M register
		If address or varaiabile name is specified, then M register is loded with specified address first
		Destinations		A, B, C, D, X, Y, FF (2), 00 (2)
		notes:
			(2) FF and 00 are not real registers only hard wired fixed values
			
	set		destination		value | label
	Set register to specified value
	Instructions takes 8 clock cycles
		Set destination register to specified value
		If label is secified instead of value, than label address is used (3) 
		Destinations	8-bit	A, B, C, D, X, Y, M1, M2 
						16-bit	M, XY, AB (4)
		notes:
			(3) Only avalible with 16-bit registers
			(4) AB is not 16-bit register, this pseudo register can be used to quickly set A and B register
				A will be loaded whith low byte and B with high byte
				
	add		destination
	Add two values
		Perform add operation with A and B register and store result in destination register
		Destinations		C, D, X, Y, M1, M2, J1, J2

	or		destination
	Perform OR logic operation
		Perform or operation with A and B register and store result in destination register
		Destinations		C, D, X, Y, M1, M2, J1, J2
